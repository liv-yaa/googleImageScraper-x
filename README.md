# googleImageScraper
for swe internship technical challenge, buzz solutions

# Description
A query that scrapes images from Google Images for the label specified and the number of images to be scraped and dowloaded specified.

Inputs: 
1. Label of the type of images to be scraped (example power lines, dogs, cats, etc.)
2. Number of images to be scraped and downloaded onto the local machine

The program should be able to scrape the images and store those images in a folder (on our local machine) with the name 
of the label (example if we are scraping images of 'dogs' then the label is 'dogs' and hence the folder where all the 
scraped images should be download should also be named 'dogs').

Points would be awarded on coding style, commenting and a documentation of executing the program.

You can use any language of your choice to build this program.
Some hints for doing this task include packages such as scrapy, selenium, beautifulsoup and urllib in Python
